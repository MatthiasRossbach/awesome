This is just a moderated collection of links which are useful for me:

* [Awesome Frontend Collection](frontend.md)
* [Awesome Development (Non-Frontend) Collection](webdev.md)
* [Awesome UI & UX Collection](design.md)
* [Awesome Conferences and Meetups Collection](connect.md)
* [Awesome Online Marketing Collection](marketing.md)
* [Awesome Sales and Pitching Collection](marketing.md)
* [Awesome Entrepreneurship Collection](entrepreneurship.md)
* [Awesome App & Tools Collection](apps.md)

Moreover I can recommend the 'official' [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) which exists for almost every (web) development related topic. Contrary to these lists my goal is NOT to add a comprehensive list of resources, but rather resources which are useful to me based on my personal day-to-day experience. Therefore I prefer to keep the lists concise. Moreover you can find inspiration from the lists at [ZEEF](https://zeef.com/)
