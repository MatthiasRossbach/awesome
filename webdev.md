# Wordpress

Even if I offered services to build Wordpress websites in the past, I cannot recommend that anymore. Not because Wordpress is a bad CMS (it is still the best OpenSource CMS in my opinion), but because most (SMB) customers are not aware that an own website is not a disposable like a flyer, but a complex technical product, which needs maintenance - like a car. Therefore: If your website budget is less than 5-digits (â‚¬) => use a website builder, they are quite good nowadays and take care of maintenance. It's much more feasible for your budget to lower your requirements instead of looking for a 'perfect' solution. I recommend: [JIMDO](https://www.jimdo.com/) (GDPR-friendly option), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) (Most customizable option) or [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/) (for e-commerce landing pages).
